1. Download the files
2. Keep the files in the same folder(Be sure that the words.txt or other text file is also in the same folder)
3. Run the Main.java and the program will run.

If you want to change the amount of the guesses or to a different file with guessable words:
Change the number 5 to other number from this line(Main.java).
Hangman hangman = new Hangman(words, 5);
Change the text file name to other files name:
WordList words = new WordList("words.txt");
Note that the words have to be in different lines so the program will work properly.
Example:
wordone
wordtwo
wordthree
