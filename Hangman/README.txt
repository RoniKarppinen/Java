This is my homework for my Programming 2 -course. It was designed by PÃ¤ivi Raulamo-Jurvanen(University of Oulu).
It takes the words from the words.txt -file and randomly picks one. It censors the letters with '*' characters and when the letter is guessed correctly, 
it removes the '*' character and replaces it with the correctly guessed letter. You can also change the amount of attempts.
It also keeps track of how many guesses are left. Correct guesses won't deduct the amount of guesses.
